# Time-Series-Analysis
In this project, the focus was on performing time series analysis and utilizing the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The main dataset used for analysis and temperature prediction was a weather dataset.

Time series analysis involves analyzing data points collected over regular intervals of time to identify patterns, trends, and make predictions. In this project, the weather dataset was used to study the historical weather patterns and understand how temperature varied over time.

The LSTM architecture was chosen for this project because it is particularly well-suited for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time series analysis. LSTM networks are designed to remember and retain important information over long sequences, which is beneficial when dealing with temporal data like weather observations.

The main objective of the project was to leverage the capabilities of LSTM networks to predict future temperature values based on the historical weather data. By training the LSTM model on the available weather dataset, it could learn patterns and relationships in the data, enabling it to make accurate temperature predictions.

The project involved various steps, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. During the data preprocessing stage, the weather dataset was cleaned, organized, and transformed to ensure it was in a suitable format for training the LSTM model.

Feature engineering involved selecting relevant features from the weather dataset that contributed to accurate temperature predictions.

The LSTM model was then trained using the prepared dataset. The model learned from the sequential patterns and relationships in the data, allowing it to make predictions about future temperature values. The performance of the model was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), to assess its accuracy in temperature prediction.

Overall, this project combined time series analysis techniques with LSTM neural networks to analyze a weather dataset and predict temperatures. The goal was to gain insights into historical weather patterns and develop a reliable model for forecasting future temperature values.
